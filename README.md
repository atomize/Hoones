## Requirements
	
- Plays NROM, and some UxROM cartidges.
- Modern Browsers ONLY (Preference to Firefox)
- There is no speed limit on the emulation so games can appear to run really really fast. Be careful!

## Notes

Always wanted to try emulation, so I began my journey by implementing what I thought was a simple console.
After about a month and some odd days, I have come to realize the ridiculousness of what needs to be done to emulate consoles. 
It was an interesting project, learned alot about optimizing javascript code. Though, I don't think I will ever try this agian.  :confounded:
